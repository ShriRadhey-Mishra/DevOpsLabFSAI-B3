# DevOpsLabFSAI-B3

This is Shri Radhey Mishra's Devops Lab.

Throughout the course of this lab I have understood the following concepts:

1. Git:
   Git is an open-source distributed version control system. We first install git in our local system and created an account on GitHub.com. There-on we learned some basic commands of git such as init, status, config, add, remove, commit, push, fetch, pull etc.
   • git init: This command is used to initialize a Git Repo on your local machine. You need to run this command once per project.
   • git status: This command will report back the status of your Git repository.
   • git clone: Used to copy a repository to your local machine.
   -> git clone "https://remainder_of_url"
   • echo "content" >> filename: This helps you create a file and store changes.
   • git add: We will add all the changes using this command.
   • git commit: We will commit our changes to the local repo and can pass a message for the commit.
   • git push: We will push the changes on our local repo to remote repo.
